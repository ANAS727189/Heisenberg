# 🧪 Heisenberg: Autonomous Chaos Engineering Agent

**Heisenberg** is an AI-powered security agent that autonomously stress-tests your APIs, detects vulnerabilities, and writes code to fix them.

## 
- **Infinity Build (Cline):** Used Cline CLI to generate custom k6 attack scripts dynamically.
- **Wakanda Data (Kestra):** Orchestrated the entire Attack -> Analyze -> Report pipeline.
- **Stormbreaker (Vercel):** Deployed a reactive real-time dashboard.

## 🏗️ Architecture
1.  **User Interface:** Next.js deployed on Vercel.
2.  **Orchestrator:** Kestra running on GitHub Codespaces (Docker-in-Docker).
3.  **Attack Engine:** Dynamic `k6` scripts generated by Python/AI.
4.  **Analysis:** Real-time log parsing to calculate "Resilience Scores".

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Open the Vercel Link.
2.  Enter the Target URL (we provided a vulnerable API route).
3.  Click **Initiate Chaos**.
4.  Watch as the Agent spins up Docker containers to stress-test the target.
